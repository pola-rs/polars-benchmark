# Polars Decision Support (PDS) benchmarks

## Disclaimer

Polars Decision Support (PDS) benchmarks are derived from the TPC-H Benchmarks and as such any results obtained using PDS are not comparable to published TPC-H Benchmark results, as the results obtained from using PDS do not comply with the TPC-H Benchmarks.

These benchmarks are our adaptation of an industry-standard decision support benchmark often used in the DataFrame library community. PDS consists of the same 22 queries as the industry standard benchmark TPC-H, but has modified parts for dataset generation and execution scripts.

From the [TPC website](https://www.tpc.org/tpch/):
> TPC-H is a decision support benchmark. It consists of a suite of business-oriented ad hoc queries and concurrent data modifications. The queries and the data populating the database have been chosen to have broad industry-wide relevance. This benchmark illustrates decision support systems that examine large volumes of data, execute queries with a high degree of complexity, and give answers to critical business questions.

## Generating PDS Benchmarking Data

### Project setup

```shell
# clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/pola-rs/pdsh.git
cd tpch/tpch-dbgen

# build tpch-dbgen
make
```

### Execute

```shell
# change directory to the root of the repository
cd ../
./run.sh
```

This will do the following,

- Create a new virtual environment with all required dependencies.
- Generate data for benchmarks.
- Run the benchmark suite.
